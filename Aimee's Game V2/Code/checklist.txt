checklist:
- question list sorting ðŸŸ¢
    - for after discarding and reinstatement of questions, the order would be mixed up,
      not useful for finding next usable key, needs lists sorted
- discarding questions ðŸŸ¢
- reinstating questions ðŸŸ¢
- question viewing:
    - preview
        - buttons dont have function
        - highlight correct answer somehow (either make green or separate label at the bottom stating the correct option)
    - quiz
        - buttons have function
            - selects chosen answer
        - ability to review previous questions, chosen answers + correct answer
        - answer order randomised (order held for already done questions,
          maybe make each question its own class that each question holds)
- play quiz
    - select difficulty option + length
        - length cant exceed number of usable questions
